## Selecting the files you want
### Weapon Types
Wishlists for the Endgame Analysis sheet can be split per Weapon Type
- Primaries only
- Ammo dependant weapons only
Or you can use the "All Weapon Types" ones to get all in one wishlist.
### Exclusivity
Wishlists that have "exclusive" in their name only look at the best of the best
- Best in Slot primaries
- S Tier Special & Power weapons
### Perks
Wishlists will mostly only look at "Major Perks" aka the two main traits of a weapon, as this is what Aegis lists in the Endgame Spreadsheet.

However, the Speedrunner's Shopping List sheet des list barrels and mags, which means you can choose the "major-perks" version or get the full, most exclusive one.

## Importing into DIM
To import the wishlists in this repo, or any other, you need to grab the "raw" URL of the one(s) you want.

The raw URL can be found by opening any wishlist's .txt file, then pressing the "raw" button found in the github header above the file. Then simply copy the URL and paste it in DIM's "Settings/Wish List/Add another wish list"
